                    Worst experience of Chinese foods. First ordered thai soup and wonton. Thai soup taste like little
                    sour. Wontons were good. Then ordered bfg special fried rice, chicken sizzling, chicken onion, beef
                    chili. Fried rice looks like khichuri. Lot of turmeric powder and found lentils (musuri dal) in
                    fried rice. Worst fried rice ever. Chicken sizzling was okay. In chicken onion, they mashed the
                    onion and made a gravy which wasn't good.
                    Overall not a good experience and good wasn't tast
                </p>
